Deadline: 11pm 12-02-2019

Create a file called solution.js and add your functions to it. Commit this file, push to your repo and submit a pr.

1. Write a JavaScript program to display the reading status (i.e. display book name, author name and reading status) of the following books.
var library = 
[
  {author: 'Bill Gates', title: 'The Road Ahead', readingStatus: true },
  { author: 'Steve Jobs', title: 'Walter Isaacson', readingStatus: true },
  { author: 'Suzanne Collins', title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games', readingStatus: false }
];

2. Write a JavaScript program which returns a subset of a string. 

Sample Data: dog
Expected Output: ["d", "do", "dog", "o", "og", "g"]

Note all functions should be in the same Javascript file. Goodluck.
